# medicine-reorder-service
â€¢	Developed an automated Medicine reorder service that helps my parents with:
o	Keeping a track of their medicine stock based on their consumption pattern.
o	Getting the reorder date based on the stock availability and consumption.
o	Downloading the quantity-to-reorder that can be shared directly with the pharmacist.
o	Updating the ordered medicines into the inventory with a simple excel upload utility.
