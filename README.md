"# medicine-reorder-service" 
#	Developed an automated Medicine reorder service that helps my parents with:
  ##	Keeping a track of their medicine stock based on their consumption pattern.
  ##	Getting the reorder date based on the stock availability and consumption.
  ##	Downloading the quantity-to-reorder that can be shared directly with the pharmacist.
  ##	Updating the ordered medicines into the inventory with a simple excel upload utility.
